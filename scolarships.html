        <h4>Scholarship Terms</h4>
        <p>Scholarship awards will be applied to the student’s tuition.  The initial award is for one year (two semesters) provided the student maintains a satisfactory academic record, i.e. a grade point average (GPA) at least as high as the minimum values listed above in an approved curriculum.   If an award recipient’s GPA falls below this minimum value then the Scholarship Committee will make a decision regarding continuation.  A student can be awarded at most one departmental scholarship per year.
